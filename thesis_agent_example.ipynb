A school\\nalways focuses on building of community identity or social identity and in case of a uniform, which\\nis same for all girls and boys for all standards; it really indulges in building up the power of quality\\namong students and focus on group or community identity rather than individuality.\\n2. Uniforms also is the biggest factor of maintaining equality off status of all students regarding of the\\neconomic, political, social and cultural and racial background a particular student or a group of\\nstudents belong. A school is a place where a child learns social values of equality and morality.\\nTherefore, if a school has only one particular uniform for all students, no child where small or a\\nteenager can boast of his/her social or economic status or cannot make a student or group of students\\nfeel inferior due to their class, caste or economic strata.\\n3.

Importance of Uniforms in Schools What is a typical school uniform. A tucked in properly ironed shirt with a trouser along with tie and a belt, all properly cleaned and neatly wore by students of all classes. Though, it may sound boring, a proper school uniform is indeed a necessity for all schools all around the world. School uniform after from maintaining a proper decorum and discipline in a school, helps to improve the behaviour of students, enhance the power of spirit, and develop a strong sense of belongingness and identity among the students with a school. Let us discuss the following advantages of Uniforms made for students for schools- 1. The biggest advantage of Student’s uniform is that it enhances the sense of uniformity and equality among the students of same standard as well as different standards of a same school. A school always focuses on building of community identity or social identity and in case of a uniform, which is same for all girls and boys for all standards; it really indulges in building up the power of quality among students and focus on group or community identity rather than individuality. 2. Uniforms also is the biggest factor of maintaining equality off status of all students regarding of the economic, political, social and cultural and racial background a particular student or a group of students belong. A school is a place where a child learns social values of equality and morality. Therefore, if a school has only one particular uniform for all students, no child where small or a teenager can boast of his/her social or economic status or cannot make a student or group of students feel inferior due to their class, caste or economic strata. 3. Uniforms also enforce discipline which is a pre requisite morality that every school should teach their students. A proper neat and clean and properly ironed uniform not only makes a child smart but also increases his behaviour and academic outcomes. It also maintains the equilibrium of a class. Suppose for example a teacher is teaching a difficult chapter, and in absence of any particular uniform students keeps admiring a student who is wearing the most attractive dress. Thus, with same uniform, the equilibrium of a class is maintained along with enhancing the efficiency and productivity of classroom teaching. 4. Apart from all these advantages, school uniforms also help to trace a student in case he/she goes missing. With proper uniform and proper identity card, many students can be saved from extorters and kidnappers while they are returning home. Thus, School Uniforms should be made necessary in each and every school.\\n×\\n* About\\n* Support\\n* Terms\\n* Privacy\\n* Copyright\\n* Cookie Preferences\\n* Do not sell or share my personal information\\nEnglish\\nCurrent Language: English\\nEspañol\\nPortuguês\\nFrançais\\nDeutsch\\n© 2023 SlideShare from Scribd\\n*\\n*\\n×\\nShare Clipboard\\n×\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\nLink\\nPublic clipboards featuring this slide\\n×\\nNo public clipboards found for this slide\\nSelect another clipboard\\n×\\nLooks like you’ve clipped this slide to already.\\nCreate a clipboard\\nYou just clipped your first slide!\\nClipping is a handy way to collect important slides you want to go back to later.

Importance of Uniforms in Schools What is a typical school uniform. A tucked in properly ironed shirt with a trouser along with tie and a belt, all properly cleaned and neatly wore by students of all classes. Though, it may sound boring, a proper school uniform is indeed a necessity for all schools all around the world. School uniform after from maintaining a proper decorum and discipline in a school, helps to improve the behaviour of students, enhance the power of spirit, and develop a strong sense of belongingness and identity among the students with a school. Let us discuss the following advantages of Uniforms made for students for schools- 1. The biggest advantage of Student’s uniform is that it enhances the sense of uniformity and equality among the students of same standard as well as different standards of a same school. A school always focuses on building of community identity or social identity and in case of a uniform, which is same for all girls and boys for all standards; it really indulges in building up the power of quality among students and focus on group or community identity rather than individuality. 2. Uniforms also is the biggest factor of maintaining equality off status of all students regarding of the economic, political, social and cultural and racial background a particular student or a group of students belong. A school is a place where a child learns social values of equality and morality. Therefore, if a school has only one particular uniform for all students, no child where small or a teenager can boast of his/her social or economic status or cannot make a student or group of students feel inferior due to their class, caste or economic strata. 3. Uniforms also enforce discipline which is a pre requisite morality that every school should teach their students. A proper neat and clean and properly ironed uniform not only makes a child smart but also increases his behaviour and academic outcomes. It also maintains the equilibrium of a class. Suppose for example a teacher is teaching a difficult chapter, and in absence of any particular uniform students keeps admiring a student who is wearing the most attractive dress. Thus, with same uniform, the equilibrium of a class is maintained along with enhancing the efficiency and productivity of classroom teaching. 4. Apart from all these advantages, school uniforms also help to trace a student in case he/she goes missing. With proper uniform and proper identity card, many students can be saved from extorters and kidnappers while they are returning home. Thus, School Uniforms should be made necessary in each and every school.\\n×\\n* About\\n* Support\\n* Terms\\n* Privacy\\n* Copyright\\n* Cookie Preferences\\n* Do not sell or share my personal information\\nEnglish\\nCurrent Language: English\\nEspañol\\nPortuguês\\nFrançais\\nDeutsch\\n© 2023 SlideShare from Scribd\\n*\\n*\\n×\\nShare Clipboard\\n×\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\nLink\\nPublic clipboards featuring this slide\\n×\\nNo public clipboards found for this slide\\nSelect another clipboard\\n×\\nLooks like you’ve clipped this slide to already.\\nCreate a clipboard\\nYou just clipped your first slide!\\nClipping is a handy way to collect important slides you want to go back to later.

Importance of Uniforms in Schools What is a typical school uniform. A tucked in properly ironed shirt with a trouser along with tie and a belt, all properly cleaned and neatly wore by students of all classes. Though, it may sound boring, a proper school uniform is indeed a necessity for all schools all around the world. School uniform after from maintaining a proper decorum and discipline in a school, helps to improve the behaviour of students, enhance the power of spirit, and develop a strong sense of belongingness and identity among the students with a school. Let us discuss the following advantages of Uniforms made for students for schools- 1. The biggest advantage of Student’s uniform is that it enhances the sense of uniformity and equality among the students of same standard as well as different standards of a same school. A school always focuses on building of community identity or social identity and in case of a uniform, which is same for all girls and boys for all standards; it really indulges in building up the power of quality among students and focus on group or community identity rather than individuality. 2. Uniforms also is the biggest factor of maintaining equality off status of all students regarding of the economic, political, social and cultural and racial background a particular student or a group of students belong. A school is a place where a child learns social values of equality and morality. Therefore, if a school has only one particular uniform for all students, no child where small or a teenager can boast of his/her social or economic status or cannot make a student or group of students feel inferior due to their class, caste or economic strata. 3. Uniforms also enforce discipline which is a pre requisite morality that every school should teach their students. A proper neat and clean and properly ironed uniform not only makes a child smart but also increases his behaviour and academic outcomes. It also maintains the equilibrium of a class. Suppose for example a teacher is teaching a difficult chapter, and in absence of any particular uniform students keeps admiring a student who is wearing the most attractive dress. Thus, with same uniform, the equilibrium of a class is maintained along with enhancing the efficiency and productivity of classroom teaching. 4. Apart from all these advantages, school uniforms also help to trace a student in case he/she goes missing. With proper uniform and proper identity card, many students can be saved from extorters and kidnappers while they are returning home. Thus, School Uniforms should be made necessary in each and every school.\\n×\\n* About\\n* Support\\n* Terms\\n* Privacy\\n* Copyright\\n* Cookie Preferences\\n* Do not sell or share my personal information\\nEnglish\\nCurrent Language: English\\nEspañol\\nPortuguês\\nFrançais\\nDeutsch\\n© 2023 SlideShare from Scribd\\n*\\n*\\n×\\nShare Clipboard\\n×\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\nLink\\nPublic clipboards featuring this slide\\n×\\nNo public clipboards found for this slide\\nSelect another clipboard\\n×\\nLooks like you’ve clipped this slide to already.\\nCreate a clipboard\\nYou just clipped your first slide!\\nClipping is a handy way to collect important slides you want to go back to later.

Importance of Uniforms in Schools What is a typical school uniform. A tucked in properly ironed shirt with a trouser along with tie and a belt, all properly cleaned and neatly wore by students of all classes. Though, it may sound boring, a proper school uniform is indeed a necessity for all schools all around the world. School uniform after from maintaining a proper decorum and discipline in a school, helps to improve the behaviour of students, enhance the power of spirit, and develop a strong sense of belongingness and identity among the students with a school. Let us discuss the following advantages of Uniforms made for students for schools- 1. The biggest advantage of Student’s uniform is that it enhances the sense of uniformity and equality among the students of same standard as well as different standards of a same school. A school always focuses on building of community identity or social identity and in case of a uniform, which is same for all girls and boys for all standards; it really indulges in building up the power of quality among students and focus on group or community identity rather than individuality. 2. Uniforms also is the biggest factor of maintaining equality off status of all students regarding of the economic, political, social and cultural and racial background a particular student or a group of students belong. A school is a place where a child learns social values of equality and morality. Therefore, if a school has only one particular uniform for all students, no child where small or a teenager can boast of his/her social or economic status or cannot make a student or group of students feel inferior due to their class, caste or economic strata. 3. Uniforms also enforce discipline which is a pre requisite morality that every school should teach their students. A proper neat and clean and properly ironed uniform not only makes a child smart but also increases his behaviour and academic outcomes. It also maintains the equilibrium of a class. Suppose for example a teacher is teaching a difficult chapter, and in absence of any particular uniform students keeps admiring a student who is wearing the most attractive dress. Thus, with same uniform, the equilibrium of a class is maintained along with enhancing the efficiency and productivity of classroom teaching. 4. Apart from all these advantages, school uniforms also help to trace a student in case he/she goes missing. With proper uniform and proper identity card, many students can be saved from extorters and kidnappers while they are returning home. Thus, School Uniforms should be made necessary in each and every school.\\n×\\n* About\\n* Support\\n* Terms\\n* Privacy\\n* Copyright\\n* Cookie Preferences\\n* Do not sell or share my personal information\\nEnglish\\nCurrent Language: English\\nEspañol\\nPortuguês\\nFrançais\\nDeutsch\\n© 2023 SlideShare from Scribd\\n*\\n*\\n×\\nShare Clipboard\\n×\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\nLink\\nPublic clipboards featuring this slide\\n×\\nNo public clipboards found for this slide\\nSelect another clipboard\\n×\\nLooks like you’ve clipped this slide to already.\\nCreate a clipboard\\nYou just clipped your first slide!\\nClipping is a handy way to collect important slides you want to go back to later.

Importance of Uniforms in Schools What is a typical school uniform. A tucked in properly ironed shirt with a trouser along with tie and a belt, all properly cleaned and neatly wore by students of all classes. Though, it may sound boring, a proper school uniform is indeed a necessity for all schools all around the world. School uniform after from maintaining a proper decorum and discipline in a school, helps to improve the behaviour of students, enhance the power of spirit, and develop a strong sense of belongingness and identity among the students with a school. Let us discuss the following advantages of Uniforms made for students for schools- 1. The biggest advantage of Student’s uniform is that it enhances the sense of uniformity and equality among the students of same standard as well as different standards of a same school. A school always focuses on building of community identity or social identity and in case of a uniform, which is same for all girls and boys for all standards; it really indulges in building up the power of quality among students and focus on group or community identity rather than individuality. 2. Uniforms also is the biggest factor of maintaining equality off status of all students regarding of the economic, political, social and cultural and racial background a particular student or a group of students belong. A school is a place where a child learns social values of equality and morality. Therefore, if a school has only one particular uniform for all students, no child where small or a teenager can boast of his/her social or economic status or cannot make a student or group of students feel inferior due to their class, caste or economic strata. 3. Uniforms also enforce discipline which is a pre requisite morality that every school should teach their students. A proper neat and clean and properly ironed uniform not only makes a child smart but also increases his behaviour and academic outcomes. It also maintains the equilibrium of a class. Suppose for example a teacher is teaching a difficult chapter, and in absence of any particular uniform students keeps admiring a student who is wearing the most attractive dress. Thus, with same uniform, the equilibrium of a class is maintained along with enhancing the efficiency and productivity of classroom teaching. 4. Apart from all these advantages, school uniforms also help to trace a student in case he/she goes missing. With proper uniform and proper identity card, many students can be saved from extorters and kidnappers while they are returning home. Thus, School Uniforms should be made necessary in each and every school.\\n×\\n* About\\n* Support\\n* Terms\\n* Privacy\\n* Copyright\\n* Cookie Preferences\\n* Do not sell or share my personal information\\nEnglish\\nCurrent Language: English\\nEspañol\\nPortuguês\\nFrançais\\nDeutsch\\n© 2023 SlideShare from Scribd\\n*\\n*\\n×\\nShare Clipboard\\n×\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\nLink\\nPublic clipboards featuring this slide\\n×\\nNo public clipboards found for this slide\\nSelect another clipboard\\n×\\nLooks like you’ve clipped this slide to already.\\nCreate a clipboard\\nYou just clipped your first slide!\\nClipping is a handy way to collect important slides you want to go back to later.

Importance of Uniforms in Schools What is a typical school uniform. A tucked in properly ironed shirt with a trouser along with tie and a belt, all properly cleaned and neatly wore by students of all classes. Though, it may sound boring, a proper school uniform is indeed a necessity for all schools all around the world. School uniform after from maintaining a proper decorum and discipline in a school, helps to improve the behaviour of students, enhance the power of spirit, and develop a strong sense of belongingness and identity among the students with a school. Let us discuss the following advantages of Uniforms made for students for schools- 1. The biggest advantage of Student’s uniform is that it enhances the sense of uniformity and equality among the students of same standard as well as different standards of a same school. A school always focuses on building of community identity or social identity and in case of a uniform, which is same for all girls and boys for all standards; it really indulges in building up the power of quality among students and focus on group or community identity rather than individuality. 2. Uniforms also is the biggest factor of maintaining equality off status of all students regarding of the economic, political, social and cultural and racial background a particular student or a group of students belong. A school is a place where a child learns social values of equality and morality. Therefore, if a school has only one particular uniform for all students, no child where small or a teenager can boast of his/her social or economic status or cannot make a student or group of students feel inferior due to their class, caste or economic strata. 3. Uniforms also enforce discipline which is a pre requisite morality that every school should teach their students. A proper neat and clean and properly ironed uniform not only makes a child smart but also increases his behaviour and academic outcomes. It also maintains the equilibrium of a class. Suppose for example a teacher is teaching a difficult chapter, and in absence of any particular uniform students keeps admiring a student who is wearing the most attractive dress. Thus, with same uniform, the equilibrium of a class is maintained along with enhancing the efficiency and productivity of classroom teaching. 4. Apart from all these advantages, school uniforms also help to trace a student in case he/she goes missing. With proper uniform and proper identity card, many students can be saved from extorters and kidnappers while they are returning home. Thus, School Uniforms should be made necessary in each and every school.\\n×\\n* About\\n* Support\\n* Terms\\n* Privacy\\n* Copyright\\n* Cookie Preferences\\n* Do not sell or share my personal information\\nEnglish\\nCurrent Language: English\\nEspañol\\nPortuguês\\nFrançais\\nDeutsch\\n© 2023 SlideShare from Scribd\\n*\\n*\\n×\\nShare Clipboard\\n×\\n* Facebook\\n* Twitter\\n* LinkedIn\\nLink\\nPublic clipboards featuring this slide\\n×\\nNo public clipboards found for this slide\\nSelect another clipboard\\n×\\nLooks like you’ve clipped this slide to already.\\nCreate a clipboard\\nYou just clipped your first slide!\\nClipping is a handy way to collect important slides you want to go back to later.
